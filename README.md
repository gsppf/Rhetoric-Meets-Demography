# Rhetoric-Meets-Demography
Causal inference toolkit for longitudinal panel data. Implements Local Projections, IPWRA, and Synthetic Control to estimate dynamic treatment effects under non-random assignment. Focus on counterfactual construction, selection correction, and robustness analysis in cross-country panel settings.

## Overview
Estimate causal dynamic treatment effects in a longitudinal cross-country panel using Local Projections, IPWRA, and Synthetic Control.

## Motivation
Provides reproducible tools to evaluate counterfactuals under nonrandom assignment with rigorous selection correction.

## Methods
- Local Projections (LP)
- Inverse Probability Weighting with Regression Adjustment (IPWRA)
- Synthetic Control Method (SCM)

## Getting Started
Dependencies: Stata 18
How to run: master.do
